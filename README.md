# Controller Icons C#
A C# port of rsubtil's Controller Icons plugin for Godot. It provides icons for all major controllers as well as automatic icon swapping system based on player input. The original plugin + more detailed information can be found here: https://github.com/rsubtil/controller_icons

Full credit to [Ricardo Subtil (rsubtil)](https://github.com/rsubtil) for putting together this incredible plugin.

## Installation and how to use
Please refer to [the original plugin](https://github.com/rsubtil/controller_icons) for detailed instructions. But there is one other additional installation step for C#.

*Note: The minimum Godot version is 4.1.2 (stable).*

**Step 1)** Download this repository and copy the `addons` folder to your project root directory.\
**Step 2a)** Create a C# solution file if you haven't already (Project -> Tools -> C# -> Create C# Solution)\
**Step 2b)** Build your project (Alt+B by default - or click the little hammer on the top right, next to the play button)\
**Step 3)** Activate **Controller Icons** in your project plugins (Project -> Project Settings -> Plugins -> Click Enabled checkbox)

You're good to go! Create a ControllerIconTexture, configure it to your needs, then use it wherever you need it. Done!

## Why make this port?
Godot supports GDScript plugins with C# projects. However, there was an unfortunate intermittent issue when using this plugin that caused the plugin to very rarely crash on game startup. Issue: https://github.com/rsubtil/controller_icons/issues/95

It appears that this may be an engine-related issue. So I ported this plugin to ensure this crash cannot happen in my C# project. However, that doesn't mean my code is bug free ðŸ˜‚

## Will I maintain this plugin to match the original plugin's improvements/fixes over time?
I am not committing to this. This effort was largely done so I could use the plugin in my own project which I need to focus on. Now that the plugin works, I likely won't come back to it unless there is something else I need. Don't hesitate to reach out if there are any issues or requests though, if I have spare time or if it's quick I can try make the changes.

## Is there anything lacking from the original plugin?
In theory, no. However, I have only done the bare-bones testing of the deprecated features. So if you were using deprecated features before, I have no clue what will happen if you try this plugin. But if you're new to the plugin, you shouldn't be using them anyways so you Shouldâ„¢ be okay.
